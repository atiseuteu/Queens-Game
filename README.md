# Queens-Game
♛ Queens Game: AI-Powered N-Queens Puzzle with Color-Region Constraints
An advanced take on the classic N-Queens puzzle, this project introduces unique colored region constraints—queens must not only avoid threatening each other but also be placed in distinct colored regions on a user-defined chessboard.

Developed in Python with Tkinter, the game features both AI Mode and Human Mode, delivering an interactive and visually rich experience that merges constraint-solving AI with engaging gameplay.

🧠 Project Overview
🔒 Constraint-Satisfying AI: Solves puzzles where queens must be in different rows, columns, diagonals and colored regions.

🎮 Two Gameplay Modes:

AI Mode: AI solves the user-defined puzzle.

Human Mode: Player solves it with hints (Easy/Medium/Hard).

🧩 Customizable Boards: Choose board sizes (4x4 to 10x10) and create colored regions interactively.

🔊 Visual + Auditory Feedback: Colorful UI, animations, and sounds enhance gameplay.

🚀 Features
✅ AI solver using optimized Backtracking with Region Constraints

🎨 Dynamic board creation using Tkinter

🧠 Real-time hint system with adaptive difficulty

📊 Real-time visualization of solution or hints

📈 Performance charts (planned) for analyzing backtracking efficiency

🎯 Difficulty levels to train or challenge users

🔍 AI Methodology
Backtracking enhanced with:

Row, column, diagonal safety checks

Region uniqueness enforcement

Hint generation based on board state and difficulty

Efficient solution exploration up to 10x10 boards

🌱 Future Scope
🖼️ Image-to-board conversion using computer vision

🌐 Web and mobile versions

🧠 ML-based hint prediction

🕹️ Multiplayer and leaderboard features
