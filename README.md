## ♛ Queens Game: AI-Powered N-Queens Puzzle with Color-Region Constraints

An advanced take on the classic N-Queens puzzle, this project introduces **unique colored region constraints**—queens must not only avoid threatening each other but also be placed in distinct colored regions on a user-defined chessboard.

Developed in **Python with Tkinter**, the game features both **AI Mode** and **Human Mode**, delivering an interactive and visually rich experience that merges constraint-solving AI with engaging gameplay.

### 🧠 Project Overview

- 🔒 **Constraint-Satisfying AI**: Solves puzzles where queens must be in different rows, columns, diagonals **and** colored regions.
- 🎮 **Two Gameplay Modes**:
  - **AI Mode**: AI solves the user-defined puzzle.
  - **Human Mode**: Player solves it with hints (Easy/Medium/Hard).
- 🧩 **Customizable Boards**: Choose board sizes (4x4 to 10x10) and create colored regions interactively.
- 🔊 **Visual + Auditory Feedback**: Colorful UI, animations, and sounds enhance gameplay.

### 🚀 Features

- ✅ AI solver using optimized **Backtracking with Region Constraints**
- 🎨 Dynamic board creation using **Tkinter**
- 🧠 Real-time **hint system** with adaptive difficulty
- 📊 Real-time visualization of solution or hints
- 📈 Performance charts (planned) for analyzing backtracking efficiency
- 🎯 Difficulty levels to train or challenge users
